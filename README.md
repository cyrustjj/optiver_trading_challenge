# optiver_trading_challenge

This repo contains the code for the 2 algos used in the optiver trading challenge as part of Imperial's Market Microstructure course jointly delivered by Optiver

The dual listing algo was the main algo ran during the challenge. The etf futures algo was written such that it could be joint with the dual listing algo into a single script to run, but it was observed that performance was hindered as compared to when the dual listing algo was optimised and ran on its own
